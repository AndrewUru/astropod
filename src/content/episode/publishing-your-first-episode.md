To publish your first episode the process is very simple.

First of all, we have to upload the audio of our episode to the internet. Astropod is designed to work with any file storage solution so you can use the platform you prefer, you can use for example DropBox, Google Drive, Cloudinary or on your own server.

For free unlimited cloud file storage we recommend use [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)

Once the file is uploaded, we return to the administration panel and press create new episode. In this step we fill in the fields between them pasting the address of the audio that we previously uploaded, we publish and we already have our first episode published.
